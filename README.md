# Frontend Mentor Projects

This is a repo containing all the little projects I completed from this amazing website [frontend-mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/home). Frontend Mentor offers around 100 projects including building components, sections, and webpages from entry to guru level that help you practice your coding skills and improve designing sense. I found doing these challenges helps me a lot, so I decided to complete as many of them as I could. Each sub-folder contains a project I completed as well detailed code, live site link, and a markdown file for review purpose.
